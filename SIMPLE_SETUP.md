# Simple Setup (Without Supabase)

If you want to test the app quickly without setting up Supabase, I can help you create a simple in-memory version that stores data locally in your browser.

## Quick Local Setup (No Database Required)

This version will:
- Store data in browser's localStorage
- Work immediately without any setup
- Perfect for testing and development
- Data stays on your computer only

Would you like me to create this simpler version? Just let me know!

## Comparison

| Feature | Supabase (Current) | Local Storage (Alternative) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Setup Time | 10-15 minutes | 0 minutes (ready now) |
| Data Persistence | Cloud (access anywhere) | Browser only |
| Multiple Devices | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Free Tier | 500MB database | Unlimited (local) |
| Best For | Production use | Quick testing |

## My Recommendation

1. **For quick testing**: Use localStorage version (I can create this)
2. **For real use**: Follow SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md (takes 15 min)

Let me know which you'd prefer and I'll help you set it up!
